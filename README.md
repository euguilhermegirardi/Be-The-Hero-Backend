# Be-The-Hero-Backend

This is the backend of the **Be-The-Hero** project developed by [**_Rocketseat_**](https://rocketseat.com.br/), a Brazilian company that teaches Node.JS, ReactJS and React Native.
This is a project where I could learn many professional techniques that is used in "the real world".

## About the project

- The **Be-The-Hero** is an application where some Non Governmental Organization can create a login and publish a service that they did to ask some help as a payment.
- The **user** can access the app and contribute with a payment to some NGO for that specific service that the NGO has done.

## The backend

The backend was developed with [**_Node.js_**](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [**_Express.js_**](https://expressjs.com/) ( _framework_ ) using MVC as a design pattern. The application is based on a server which is the [**_SQLite_**](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html).
The REST API was tested using [**_Insomnia_**](https://insomnia.rest/) and I also used [**Knex.js**](http://knexjs.org/), a SQL Query Builder for JavaScript, which helped creating the tables for the NGO and it's incidentes registered.
